                <p>With a decade of experience driving productions in manufacturing environments, I am eager to
                    transition my career
                    into the dynamic field of programming.</p>

                <p>
                    Throughout my career, I have successfully led cross-functional teams in implementing lean
                    manufacturing principles,
                    optimizing production processes, and delivering innovative solutions. My experience has equipped me
                    with a strong
                    problem-solving mindset and a commitment to continuous improvement.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Programming has always been a passion of mine, and I am excited to apply my newly acquired skills to
                    a professional
                    setting. Over the past few years, I have dedicated myself to intensive study, completing a
                    Full-Stack Web Development
                    program with honors (19/20) and a Python programming course.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My technical skills include proficiency in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, SQL, Java, JavaScript, PHP, C, and
                    Python, along with
                    experience using frameworks such as Django. AS a freelancer, I have successfully applied these
                    skills to create the
                    Snupe landing page (www.snupe.pt) and develop custom tools and databases for client management,
                    sales tracking,
                    and inventory for Snupe.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am eager to join a team where I can continue to learn and grow as a programmer. I am confident
                    that my strong work
                    ethic, coupled with my enthusiasm for coding, will make me a valuable asset to your organization.

                    <br>
                    This was my first freelance project, and the initial stage was quite challenging, with no defined

                    <br>
                    The simulator was capable of quantifying paint, flooring, doors, windows, and differentiating
                    between renovation and new installations, making it incredibly comprehensive. Data was compiled and
                    ready for database storage.

                    could be edited, removed, hidden, or added with ease.
                    <br>
                    This was also the only website I had the opportunity to build from a designer's perspective.
